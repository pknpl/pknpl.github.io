Re-reading 2.2 snippet: 'MKCL will provide after the Payment...'. But snippet 2.1 says 'ALC has to arrange at their own'. **Correction based on latest snippet 2.2:** MKCL provides it after payment. However, snippet 2.1 (older/variant) says own arrangement. The safest answer aligns with the Fee component: MKCL provides licenses *against the fee*.
